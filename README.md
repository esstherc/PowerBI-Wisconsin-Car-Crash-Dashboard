## Demo 
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDELlRKnYrM&ab_channel=YanbingChen)
- [PowerBI Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZjJiZTBiZjYtZmM1MC00YzQyLWE5YTctN2FjZWVmOGZhM2M3IiwidCI6IjZmMGJiNzJmLTUzNzctNGRkZi05MzZhLWI2YzcyYmYyMWFlMiIsImMiOjF9&pageName=ReportSection122b823e02231482f562)
- The map displayed in the PowerBI Dashboard contains over 30,000 dots, exceeding the limit for publishing reports, which is fewer than 30,000 dots. As a result, the map feature may not be visible in the published version of the report. However, all other features of the dashboard are functioning properly and are available for use.

## Introduction
- This project is aimed at developing a Power BI Dashboard for generating insights about car crash accident data in Wisconsin, US.

## Dataset
#### Original dataset
- [Countrywide traffic accident dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05409.pdf
) (February 2016 to March 2023)
- Approximately 7.7 million records of traffic accidents

#### Data Preprocessing 
- Python(filtering and create new categorical columns)
- Power BI (Calculating new data fields)
- Dataset: 34688 WI Records out of 7.7 million data

## Target Audience
- Government entities and policymakers (Local and state transportation departments,emergency services......)
- Wisconsin residents

## Potential Research Questions
1. What is the spatial pattern of traffic accidents in Wisconsin?  
2. Are there specific times of day or month when traffic accidents are more likely to occur, and what is their impact on traffic patterns?  
3. How do traffic signs and signals, road infrastructure, and traffic calming measures influence the frequency and severity of traffic accidents in Wisconsin?  
4. How do weather conditions or other environmental stimuli affect the occurrence of traffic accidents?  

## Installation / Usage
